Gmail Email Thread Flipper
🧵✨ Threadflip — Gmail Meets Outlook, But Cooler
Ever screamed at Gmail for stacking your newest replies at the bottom like it’s 2005? Yeah, same. Threadflip is the Chrome extension born from one simple truth: I needed Gmail to behave like Outlook — newest thread on top, conversation clear as day, sanity intact.

So I built it. Now you can flip your Gmail threads upside-down (or right-side-up, depending on how you look at it) and make sense of the madness.

What’s in the magic box?
📌 Thread untangler: Tame those endless back-and-forths.
🔝 Outlook-style view: Newest replies first. Like nature intended.
✨ One-click wizardry: No arcane settings, just pure productivity.

Why?
Because we deserve a Gmail that acts like Outlook when we want it to. No more scrolling marathons just to find what Bob said last. Flip it. Read it. Done.

I did it just for me, but thought I would share with everyone.

✨ Install it. Use it. Love it. Contribute.
Break it? Good. Open a PR. Let’s bend Gmail to our will — together.
